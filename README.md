# Android-Projects

This repository contains a list of projects that I have worked on (and will continue to work on extend with new features) in order to improve my Android development skills. These projects stem from The Complete Android N Developer Course on Udemy. Some of the projects include the following:

### Intro To Android Studio
  - **Currency Converter:** This is a small app that when given an amount, converts US Dollars (USD) to Pounds (EUR) 
  
### Images, Video, and Sound
  - **Basic Phrases:** This app takes eight phrases in English, and when the corresponding phrase is tapped, an audio clip of that phrase will be played in a given language (currently Spanish)
  
  - **Connect 3:** A small, makeshift tic-tac-toe game. This incorporates the concepts of Animations, GridLayouts, and ImageViews

### Advanced Android Features
  - **EggTimer:** A small "egg timer" app that incorporates the use of a seekbar to set the timer, which can go up to 10 minutes
  
  - **Brain Trianer:** How good is your addition skills? This app is a small game where you have 30 seconds to answer as many additon equations as fast as you can. See how many you can get!
  
  - **Guess the Celebrity:** This app is a small game where a random photo of a celebrity is shown, and you get to guess who the celebrity is (multiple choice format). This incorporates the concept of downloading web content, as well as the use of Android's AsyncTasks and regular expressions classes.
