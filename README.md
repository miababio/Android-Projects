# Android-Projects

This repository contains a list of projects that I have worked on in order to improve my Android development skills. These projects stem from The Complete Android Developer Course on Udemy. Some of the projects include the following:

### Intro To Android Studio
  - **Currency Converter:** This is a small app that when given an amount, converts US Dollars (USD) to Pounds (EUR) 
  
### Images, Video, and Sound
  - **Basic Phrases:** This app takes eight phrases in English, and when the corresponding phrase is tapped, an audio clip of that phrase will be played in a given language (currently Spanish)
  
  - **Connect 3:** A small, makeshift tic-tac-toe game. This incorporates the concepts of Animations, GridLayouts, and ImageViews
